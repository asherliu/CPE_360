# CPE 360: Computational Data Structure & Algorithms @ Stevens Institute of Technology


----
Course Outline
----

- Lecture 1 - 2: C/C++ Basics, Matrix Multiplication.

- Lecture 3 - 4: Linked List, Queue, Stack and Recursion.

- Lecture 5 - 6: Searching, e.g., linear search and binary search.

- Lecture 7 - 8: Using time consumption to understand time complexity, e.g., Big O notation. We will measure the time consumption of binary search (logn), linear search (n), quick sort (nlogn), matrix multiplication (n^3).

- Lecture 9 - 10: Tree and binary search tree.

- Lecture 11 - 12 and 15: Binary search tree, searching, insertion and deletion.

- Lecture 13 - 14: Midterm and midterm review.

- Lecture 15 - 16: Priority queue and heap.

- Lecture 17 - 20: Sorting, i.e., bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and radix sort.

- Lecture 21 - 22: Hash table.

- Lecture 23 - 25: Graph and graph traversal algorithms.

- Lecture 26: Final.
